(defmacro with-thunk ((var &rest args) &body body)
  "A macro-writing macro for the `call-with-' style.

In the `call-with-' style of writing macros, the macro is simply a
syntactic convenience that wraps its body in a thunk and a call to the
function that does the actual work.

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      `(call-with-foo (lambda () ,@body)))

The `call-with-' style has many advantages. Functions are easier to
write than macros; you can change the behavior of a function without
having to recompile all its callers; functions can be traced, appear
in backtraces, etc.

But meanwhile, all those thunks are being allocated on the heap. Can
we avoid this? Yes, but at a high cost in boilerplate: the closure has
to be given a name (using `flet') so it can be declared
`dynamic-extent'.

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      (with-gensyms (thunk)
        `(flet ((,thunk () ,@body))
           (declare (dynamic-extent #',thunk))
           (call-with-foo #',thunk))))

`with-thunk' avoids the boilerplate:

    (defmacro with-foo (&body body)
      (with-thunk (body)
        `(call-with-foo ,body)))

It is also possible to construct a \"thunk\" with arguments.

    (with-thunk (body foo)
      `(call-with-foo ,body))
    â‰¡ `(flet ((,thunk (,foo)
          ,@body))
        (declare (dynamic-extent #',thunk))
        (call-with-foo #',thunk))

Needs a better name."

(defmacro define-do-macro (name binds &body body)
  "Define an iteration macro like `dolist'.

Writing a macro like `dolist' is more complicated than it looks. For
consistency with the rest of CL, you have to do all of the following:

- The entire loop must be surrounded with an implicit `nil' block.
- The body of the loop must be an implicit `tagbody'.
- There must be an optional `return' form which, if given, supplies
  the values to return from the loop. While this return form is
  being evaluated, the iteration variables are bound to `nil'.

Say you wanted to define a `do-hash' macro that iterates over hash
tables. A full implementation would look like this:

     (defmacro do-hash ((key value hash-table &optional return) &body body)
       (multiple-value-bind (body decls) (parse-body body)
         `(block nil
            (maphash (lambda (,key ,value)
                       ,@decls
                       (tagbody
                          ,@body))
                     ,hash-table)
            ,(when return
               `(let (,key ,value)
                  ,return)))))

Using `define-do-macro' takes care of all of this for you.
